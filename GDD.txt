                  Game Design Document (Draft)
================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aetheris is a first-person survival game with moderate challenge
and steady progression. Death is punishing but fair. The world
rewards exploration and experimentation. Your "class" is defined
entirely by the weapons and totems you carry — there is no class
selection screen.

----------------------------------------------------------------
CLASS SYSTEM
----------------------------------------------------------------
There are 8 recognized archetypes, but they aren't chosen from
a menu. You become your class by what you equip. No weapon
locks — any build can use any weapon, but totems reward
specialization. No innate passives — everything comes from
totems and weapons.

TOTEMS are the core identity system. You can carry up to 5.
They augment your stats, unlock active skills, and modify your
attack timing. Some totems only activate meaningfully with
certain weapon types.

REVIVAL TOKENS
  Found in the world only — cannot be crafted.
  Cannot be stacked, one held at a time.
  No cooldown — scarcity is the balance mechanic.
  Can be used on self (bypasses corpse beacon, keep all items)
  or on a dead teammate (they revive with full loot intact).

-- ROGUE --
  Totem:   Shade Totem (required for build identity)
  Weapons: Daggers, short bows
  Cannot parry. Shade Totem disables it entirely.
  In exchange: dodge rolls travel farther and have longer
  I-frames than any other build. Punishes enemies between
  their attacks. Fragile if caught standing still.

-- KNIGHT --
  Totem:   Shield totems, counter totems
  Weapons: Sword, Spear
  The parry specialist. Shield bash interrupts enemy attacks
  and staggers them, opening a counter window. Totems can
  extend the counter window or buff counter damage. Slowest
  dodge roll of any build but highest damage ceiling when
  playing reactively. Rewards reading enemy patterns.

-- SWORDMAGE --
  Totem:   Infusion totems
  Weapons: Sword, Staff
  Mid-combat weapon infusion — totem skill temporarily coats
  a melee weapon with a magic element (fire, frost, void,
  etc.), changing its passive trait and adding elemental
  damage for a limited time. Swapping totems mid-fight changes
  what infusion is available. High skill ceiling, strong burst
  windows.

-- SUMMONER --
  Totem:   Bond totems
  Weapons: Staff, any
  Finds eggs and cores hidden throughout the world. Eggs hatch
  into permanent companions with their own AI, health pool,
  and loose level scaling. Max 2 permanent companions.
  Permanent companions are permadeath — losing one is a
  meaningful setback, they do not respawn.
  Bond totems also unlock temporary companions on a time limit,
  with no cap on how many can be active. Temp companions act
  as fodder and distraction. Weakest solo early, strongest in
  sustained fights mid to late game.

-- ARCHER --
  Totem:   Quiver totems, sight totems
  Weapons: Bow
  Pure ranged. Totem skills add effects to arrows — pierce,
  split shot, elemental coating, trap arrows. Drawing the bow
  drains stamina so resource management is critical. Sight
  totems extend range and reduce sway. Weakest in enclosed
  spaces, devastating in open terrain and the Aether.

-- CLERIC --
  Totem:   Blessing totems, ward totems
  Weapons: Staff, Mace
  Team support anchor. Carries Revival Tokens found in the
  world to revive dead teammates, bypassing the corpse beacon.
  Ward totems place damage-absorbing fields. Blessing totems
  buff nearby allies' sanity and stamina regen. Solo Cleric is
  viable but slower — pays off heavily in server groups.

-- APOTHECARY --
  Totem:   Brew totems
  Weapons: Dagger, any
  Field alchemist. Brew totems unlock on-the-fly splash potion
  crafting from carried ingredients — no workbench needed.
  Potions heal, poison, disorient, slow, or apply elemental
  effects to a target area. The only build with reliable AoE
  damage outside of magic. Strong sanity tools. Weak in direct
  melee but excellent at controlling a fight's tempo.

-- MONK --
  Totem:   Discipline totems
  Weapons: Spear, Fists (unarmed — highest base attack speed)
  The only build with a unique resource meter: the DISCIPLINE
  METER. Fills by landing hits and successfully parrying.
  Spent to instantly clear sanity buildup or trigger a heal.
  Cannot be used offensively — purely a survival resource.
  A Monk who whiffs and eats hits bleeds the meter dry.
  Pairs best with high attack speed weapons to fill quickly.

----------------------------------------------------------------
CORE MECHANICS
----------------------------------------------------------------

COMBAT
  - All attacks have start lag and end lag, tuned per weapon
    and active totems.
  - Parry window is tight — skill rewarded, not spam.
  - Dodge roll has I-frames. Rogue builds get longer rolls and
    longer I-frames via the Shade Totem.
  - Stamina gates sprinting, dodging, and heavy attacks.

DEATH & CORPSE SYSTEM
  - On death, your corpse becomes an Undead Knight.
  - A beacon spawns at your death location.
  - You respawn with nothing — bare hands.
  - To recover your items, find the beacon and slay your old
    corpse.
  - On a multiplayer server, if another player kills your
    Undead Knight first, they get your loot.

SURVIVAL METERS
  - Hunger & Thirst — deplete over time. At low levels they
    drain stamina and sanity.
  - Stamina — governs dodges, sprints, and heavy attacks.
    Regenerates out of combat.
  - Sanity — drains in dark areas and caves, and on certain
    hits. At 0% a Corruption Event triggers.

CORRUPTION EVENT
  When sanity hits 0%:
    - Mobs aggro from farther away.
    - Phantom enemies appear that deal real damage.
    - HUD and audio distort.
  Reset sanity by eating specific foods, using Cleric totems,
  or sleeping.

----------------------------------------------------------------
MOBS
----------------------------------------------------------------

WYVERN
  A weaker cousin of the dragon. Dives and swoops to attack.
  To stun it, build or place a wall in its flight path, then
  attack while it's grounded.
  Drops: Wyvern Wing (needed to craft the glide item).
  Spawns: Open overworld and cliff areas.

UNDEAD KNIGHT
  Rare but dangerous. Can parry and dodge the player's attacks.
  Spawns weaker undead mobs around it as protection.
  Scales with player level.
  Drops: High-tier loot.
  Note: Your death corpse becomes a version of this.

HEADCRAWLER (name pending)
  A fast, erratic creature that lunges without warning.
  Low health but deals sanity damage on hit.
  Spawns alone in caves.
  Purpose: Makes caves feel unsafe even at high level.

----------------------------------------------------------------
PROGRESSION
----------------------------------------------------------------

== OVERWORLD ==
The starting layer. Familiar but deceptively dangerous.

  1. Bare Hands — punch trees, gather flint
  2. Flint Tools — basic axe, knife, small game hunting
  3. Stone Tools — full early kit, build shelter
  4. First Minor Boss — field guardian or corrupted beast;
     drops a key crafting material
  5. First Workbench — unlocks mid-tier recipes
  6. Iron-Equivalent Tools — better weapons and gathering
  7. First Overworld Dungeon — structured encounters,
     mini-bosses, first totem exposure
  8. First Forge — unlocks weapon smithing and alloys
  9. First Alloy — stronger than iron
 10. Caves unlocked

== CAVES ==
Dark, claustrophobic, resource-rich. Sanity drains faster here.

  - Headcrawlers make early caves dangerous
  - New ore tiers found only underground
  - Second Workbench tier found inside cave dungeon
  - Cave Boss — drops a crafting material and reveals the
    Aether Structure location on the map
  - Deeper caves have bioluminescent zones with unique
    crafting materials
  - Second Forge tier — unlocks advanced alloys

== AETHER ==
A sky realm. Floaty, bright, deceptively peaceful.
Platforms drift and shift. Gravity is reduced.

  - Activate by finding and powering the Aether Structure
    (revealed after clearing the Cave dungeon)
  - Dodge rolls go farther, falls are slower
  - Wyvern variants are common here — the Wyvern Wing glider
    is near-mandatory
  - Aether Dungeon has a vertical layout requiring gliding
    and platforming skill
  - Aether-exclusive totems drop here — highest sanity buffs
    in the game

  THE CELESTIAL LOCK (Aether Gate into the Final Dimension):

  Boss 1 — The Aether Warden
    A massive aerial guardian. Standard weapons work here.
    On death it drops the AETHER CORE.

  Crafting the Gate Weapons
    Take the Aether Core to the Aether Forge.
    It splits into 3 weapons:

      Skyblade        — melee, fast, bonus damage on aerial
                        targets. Suits Knight / Monk / Rogue.
      Starcaller Bow  — ranged, arrows pierce multiple enemies.
                        Suits Archer.
      Voidweave Staff — magic catalyst, enables full-power
                        spellcasting. Suits Summoner /
                        Swordmage / Cleric.

    Apothecary builds support whoever wields the three weapons
    rather than needing a gate weapon themselves.

  Boss 2 — The Final Sentinel
    Sits at the threshold between the Aether and the Final
    Dimension. Completely immune to everything EXCEPT the three
    gate weapons. No chip damage, no totem effects, no magic
    not cast through the Voidweave Staff.

    Forces server groups to coordinate across all three
    archetypes. Solo players must craft all three and
    weapon-swap mid-fight.

    Drops: VOID SHARD — activates the Final Dimension structure.

== FINAL DIMENSION (name TBD) ==
The endgame. Alien, hostile, visually distinct from everything
prior.

  - Sanity drains constantly — Cleric and Apothecary shine here
  - All previous mob types appear as corrupted variants
  - Final Dungeon — the longest in the game, designed for a
    server group
  - Final Boss — drops end-game materials and triggers the
    win condition

  WIN CONDITION:
    Craft the AETHERIC CORE and place it at the world's spawn
    point. This permanently stabilizes the corruption for that
    server. It's a server-wide event — everyone benefits or
    competes for it.

----------------------------------------------------------------
MULTIPLAYER
----------------------------------------------------------------
  - Persistent world servers (like Minecraft / Rust)
  - PvP or PvE server flags
  - Other players can loot your Undead Knight if they kill it
  - The Aetheric Core win condition affects the whole server
  - Sanity corruption events are local to each player

----------------------------------------------------------------
WEAPON FORGING SYSTEM
----------------------------------------------------------------

THE PROCESS
  Ores are smelted into liquid at a forge and poured into part
  casts. Casts are molds for specific weapon parts — find or
  unlock the cast pattern, fill it with molten material, and
  assemble the parts into a finished weapon.

  Higher tier ores require higher tier forges to smelt. You
  cannot cheat progression by carrying ore forward — the forge
  is the gate, not the ore.

FORGE TIERS
  Tier 1 (Overworld, early)       — smelts Overworld Groups 1 & 2
  Tier 2 (Overworld, post-dungeon)— smelts Overworld Group 3
                                    and Cave Group 1
  Tier 3 (Caves)                  — smelts Cave Groups 2 & 3
                                    and Aether Group 1
  Tier 4 (Aether)                 — smelts Aether Groups 2 & 3
                                    and Final Dimension ores

WEAPON PARTS BY TYPE
  Each part is cast separately and contributes its own stats.

  Sword   — Blade, Guard, Handle
  Bow     — Limbs, Grip, String Anchor
  Staff   — Focus Gem, Shaft, Base
  Axe     — Head, Beard, Handle
  Dagger  — Blade, Grip (2 parts, simplest weapon)
  Spear   — Head, Pole, Butt Cap

WHAT PARTS CONTRIBUTE
  Every part pulls from its material's stat pool:

  Durability           — how long before the weapon needs repair
  Attack Speed         — affects start and end lag
  Passive Trait        — a single passive effect tied to the ore
  Synergy Bonus        — if two or more parts share the same ore
                         GROUP (not the same ore), a bonus trait
                         activates on top of individual stats

  Synergy rewards mixing within a group without forcing one
  correct combo. Two different ores from the same group will
  always synergize. Two ores from different groups never will.

ORE GROUPS
  Groups within the same dimension are lateral — no best option,
  just different strengths and traits. Groups in higher
  dimensions are strictly stronger than those below.

  -- OVERWORLD --

  Group 1 (early)
    Ashfen    — high durability, trait: minor lifesteal
    Greyveil  — balanced stats, trait: slow on hit

  Group 2 (mid)
    Duskram   — high attack speed, trait: bleed on hit
    Emberrak  — high durability, trait: stamina cost reduction

  Group 3 (late)
    Scorvite  — very high attack speed, trait: burn on hit
    Thornvel  — very high durability, trait: extended bleed

  -- CAVES --

  Group 1
    Murkvein  — high durability, trait: blindness on hit
    Gloomite  — high attack speed, trait: sanity drain aura

  Group 2
    Vaulmar   — balanced, trait: echo damage (delayed 2nd hit)
    Hollowfen — high durability, trait: lifesteal

  Group 3
    Abyssram  — high attack speed, trait: fear on hit
    Cryptveil — high durability, trait: stacking poison

  -- AETHER --

  Group 1
    Driftfen  — high attack speed, trait: float on kill
    Veilstone — high durability, trait: reduced fall damage

  Group 2
    Stormveil — balanced, trait: chain lightning on hit
    Skyvein   — high attack speed, trait: aerial damage bonus

  Group 3
    Solenvite — high attack speed, trait: sanity restore on kill
    Voidglass — high durability, trait: damage scales with height

  -- FINAL DIMENSION --

  Group 1
    Corrveil  — high attack speed, trait: corruption burst
    Ashvoid   — high durability, trait: health drain aura

  Group 2
    Voidheart — balanced, trait: nullify enemy passive on hit
    Nullvite  — high attack speed, trait: stamina refill on kill

  Group 3 (endgame)
    Aethramite — high durability, trait: all damage types at once
    Voidram    — high attack speed, trait: instant kill threshold

SYNERGY EXAMPLE
  Sword with Ashfen Blade + Ashfen Guard + Greyveil Handle:
    Each part gives its individual trait, PLUS the Group 1
    overworld synergy bonus activates — e.g. 10% chance to
    trigger all three traits simultaneously on a hit.

  Swap the Guard for a Duskram Guard (Group 2):
    No synergy. But you gain bleed on hit from the Guard slot,
    which may suit your build better. Neither is wrong.

----------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS NOT YET DECIDED
----------------------------------------------------------------
  - Cave Boss identity and fight gimmick
  - Final Dimension name
  - Full totem list (what each of the base totems does)
  - Whether food also restores sanity/stamina or is purely
    survival
  - Temperature and weather (could complement each dimension
    naturally — caves are cold, Aether has thin air, etc.)
