                        AETHERIS
                  Game Design Document (Draft)
================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aetheris is a first-person survival game with moderate challenge
and steady progression. Death is punishing but fair. The world
rewards exploration and experimentation. Your "class" is defined
entirely by the weapons and totems you carry — there is no class
selection screen.

----------------------------------------------------------------
THE PLAYER CHARACTER — THE CROW
----------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THE PLAYER IS
  The player character is a crow demi-human — not born,
  but made. Partially avian in appearance: dark feathers
  along the forearms and shoulders, eyes with a crow's
  reflective quality, bone structure that suggests flight
  ancestry without enabling it. Humanoid enough to use
  tools, weapons, and forges. Inhuman enough that the
  world treats them differently than it treats humans.

  They do not know they were created. They wake in the
  world with purpose — a felt sense of direction, an
  instinct toward specific places and actions — but no
  memory of origin, no awareness of what they are, no
  understanding of why they are drawn toward the things
  they are drawn toward. They experience themselves as
  a person who has always existed and simply cannot
  recall the early parts.

  The player and the player character discover the truth
  simultaneously. There is no moment where the character
  is told something the player already knows. The lore
  delivery — item descriptions, cult remnants, Aethon
  notes that reference something created to carry a
  counter-frequency — reaches both at the same pace.
  When the community figures out what the Crow is, the
  Crow is figuring it out too.

WHO CREATED THEM — THE ORDER OF THE HOLLOW WING
  A clandestine organization that operated in the margins
  of the kingdom's civilization. Not rebels, not
  revolutionaries in any conventional sense — the Order
  understood, through long study of Aethon's ruins and
  the world's deteriorating response to human activity,
  that the kingdom was crossing the same thresholds
  Aethon crossed. They had read the Observatory notes.
  They had visited the Excavation. They had watched the
  Ashfields expand and the Logged Vale go silent and
  the Open Pit collapse inward, and they understood
  what all of it meant when taken together.

  They also understood that no human could survive long
  enough or move freely enough through the corruption
  to complete the task they had identified as necessary.
  The world's immune response targeted human biology
  specifically. A human carrying the Aetheric Core
  toward the Final Dimension would be consumed long
  before arriving.

  So they made something that wasn't human.

  The Order studied the world's own biology — the
  corruption, the way certain creatures moved through
  it without harm, the behavior of the world's native
  fauna versus its human inhabitants. Crows specifically
  were observed to nest near corruption scars without
  ill effect. They appeared in higher numbers near
  Aethon ruins. They were not affected by the sanity
  drain that devastated human explorers in the deep
  caves and dark spaces.

  The Order spent an unknown number of years — their
  own records are fragmented, hidden in locations
  across the world in pieces the player assembles
  gradually — engineering a being that could carry
  the world's counter-frequency through the corruption
  and into the Final Dimension. They used crow biology
  as a foundation because the world did not register
  crows as damage. The result was the Crow: fully
  sapient, fully capable, built for a purpose neither
  it nor the player understands at the start.

  The Order is gone by the time the game begins.
  Whether they were destroyed by the kingdom — who
  would have had reason to suppress anyone who
  understood the truth about the environmental damage —
  or simply died out waiting for their creation to
  awaken is left deliberately ambiguous. Their notes
  exist. Their hidden safehouses exist, scattered
  across the world as discoverable POIs. But there
  is no living member to explain anything.

  The Crow is alone in the world with a purpose
  it was built for and a history it cannot access.

THE ORDER'S HIDDEN SAFEHOUSES
  Small structures, easily missed, visually
  indistinguishable from abandoned homesteads until
  players enter and find the contents — Order sigils
  on the walls, fragments of research notes, materials
  cached for a traveler who was expected to arrive,
  personal letters from Order members to each other
  that reveal the organization's history and internal
  disagreements in human terms.

  The safehouses are not marked. They are found by
  exploration or community mapping. Each one contains
  one piece of the Order's story and one practical
  reward — materials, a totem, a blueprint — ensuring
  that engaging with the lore is always worth the
  detour mechanically.

  The final safehouse, findable only after reaching
  the Aether, contains the most complete record of
  what the Crow is and why. It is written as a letter
  addressed to no name, beginning: "if you are reading
  this, you found us before you found yourself. that
  is the correct order. we are sorry for the weight
  of what comes next."

WHY THE CROW FIGHTS ALDRIC
  The Order's final active operation before their
  disappearance was establishing a network of contacts
  and cleared paths that the Crow would need to
  traverse. Aldric's dungeon sits directly on the
  route toward the cave entrance — the collapsed
  palace is the only viable path through the cliff
  formation that separates the starting area from
  the cave approaches.

  A surviving Order instruction cache, findable
  early in the game, contains a single directive
  written in the clipped language of someone who
  expected to give more instructions later but ran
  out of time: "the palace. clear it. the path is
  underneath." No explanation of who Aldric is,
  no acknowledgment of what the player will find
  there. The Order expected to be present to provide
  context. They are not.

  The player follows the instruction because it is
  the only instruction they have. They do not know
  Aldric was a king. They do not know the dungeon
  is a palace until they are inside it. Aldric
  attacks them because Aldric attacks everything
  that enters — he is not a gatekeeper with a
  reason, just a broken thing that responds to
  presence with violence. The tragedy of the fight
  is entirely retrospective, assembled from the
  dungeon's environmental storytelling rather than
  from anything the Crow is told.

THE CROW'S SANITY — FLAVORED DIFFERENTLY
  The sanity meter exists for the Crow as it does
  for any player, but what it represents is different.
  Human sanity drain is the world's immune response
  recognizing and targeting human biology — the
  darkness, the corruption, the deep caves are
  hostile to human presence at a fundamental level.

  The Crow is not human. The world does not target
  them the same way. Their sanity drain is not
  hostility — it is resonance. The corruption is
  the world's signal, and the Crow is built from
  material close enough to the world's own biology
  to receive it. Too much signal without grounding
  produces the same mechanical result — a Corruption
  Event — but the flavor is different. Human sanity
  breaks under assault. The Crow's sanity frays
  under saturation.

  This distinction is expressed through audio and
  visual design rather than different mechanics.
  Human Corruption Events should feel like an attack.
  The Crow's should feel like being overwhelmed by
  something that isn't trying to harm them.

  The practical implication: the Crow can venture
  deeper into corrupted spaces than a human before
  triggering an Event, but prolonged exposure
  accumulates differently. Players who treat the
  sanity meter as they would on a human character
  will find it behaves with slightly different
  rhythm — not punishingly, just unexpectedly.

  This resonance is the most important thing about
  the Crow. It is also what the ending takes away.
  The sanity meter's strange behavior throughout
  the game is the world talking. Players who reach
  the ending will understand retroactively what
  the signal was, and what its absence means.

THE ENDING AND THE CROW
  The Aetheric Core fires. The Wound recedes.
  The corruption stops spreading. The world
  continues.

  Nobody acknowledges what just happened.

  No NPC speaks to it. No notification, no
  server message beyond the mechanical win
  condition log. The other players on the
  server are alive and their worlds are
  intact and they go back to whatever they
  were doing. The Crow stands at the Core
  site and the game simply continues. There
  is no parade. There is no recognition.
  The thing that was built for a single
  purpose has completed that purpose and
  the world has moved on in the same breath.

  The sky is wrong now. Where the Aether
  used to be visible — a faint luminous
  layer above the clouds, present as a
  background element since the opening
  moments of the game — there is nothing.
  Not darkness. Not cloud cover. Just
  absence. A permanent scar where an
  entire dimension used to be, visible
  from anywhere in the world on a clear
  day. Players who never reached the
  Aether will notice something changed
  about the sky without knowing what.
  Players who cleared the Aether Dungeon
  and fought Velith will know exactly
  what they are looking at.

  The crows come to the Core site.

  Not immediately — over the hours and
  days following the activation, natural
  crows begin gathering at the location
  where the Core was placed. They do not
  behave unusually. They do not circle
  or call or perform. They simply land
  nearby and stay. More arrive over time.
  Players who return to the site days
  later will find a significant flock,
  still there, still quiet. No explanation
  is given. No explanation exists in any
  note or item description anywhere in
  the game. It just happens.

  Whether it means the world is watching,
  mourning, or recognizing something in
  the Crow that it never articulated is
  left entirely open. The Order's sigil
  was a crow in flight. The Order is gone.
  The crows remain.

  The final note found at the activation
  site: "the readings have stabilized.
  the anomaly has accepted containment.
  we are logging this as a success."
  No author. No writing system that
  appears anywhere else in the game.
  Rendered in the player's language
  without explanation.

  The world kept records. It always
  watched. It considered this a success.

  The Crow can keep playing. The world
  is still here. It just no longer
  needs them.

CROW MOTIF IN THE WORLD
  Natural crows appear throughout the game as an
  environmental constant. They are present near
  Aethon ruins before the player understands the
  significance. They nest at corruption scars without
  ill effect. They are the only wildlife that does
  not flee from Headcrawlers. In the Aether they
  appear on drifting platforms far above where any
  natural crow should be.

  They never interact with the player directly.
  They never flock toward the player or respond
  to player actions. They are simply present,
  consistently, in the places that matter.

  Players who notice the pattern early will have
  questions the game will eventually answer.
  Players who notice it late will experience
  retroactive recognition — realizing the crows
  were always there, in every significant location,
  the entire time.

  The Order's sigil is a crow in flight. It appears
  in their safehouses, on their equipment, in the
  margins of their notes. No Order member explains
  why they chose it. By the time players find the
  final safehouse letter, they will understand
  without being told.

----------------------------------------------------------------
CLASS SYSTEM
----------------------------------------------------------------
There are 8 recognized archetypes, but they aren't chosen from
a menu. You become your class by what you equip. No weapon
locks — any build can use any weapon, but totems reward
specialization. No innate passives — everything comes from
totems and weapons.

TOTEMS are the core identity system. You can carry up to 5.
They augment your stats, unlock active skills, and modify your
attack timing. Some totems only activate meaningfully with
certain weapon types.

REVIVAL TOKENS
  Found in the world only — cannot be crafted.
  Cannot be stacked, one held at a time.
  No cooldown — scarcity is the balance mechanic.
  Can be used on self (bypasses corpse beacon, keep all items)
  or on a dead teammate (they revive with full loot intact).

-- ROGUE --
  Totem:   Shade Totem (required for build identity)
  Weapons: Daggers, short bows
  Cannot parry. Shade Totem disables it entirely.
  In exchange: dodge rolls travel farther and have longer
  I-frames than any other build. Punishes enemies between
  their attacks. Fragile if caught standing still.

-- KNIGHT --
  Totem:   Shield totems, counter totems
  Weapons: Sword, Spear
  The parry specialist. Shield bash interrupts enemy attacks
  and staggers them, opening a counter window. Totems can
  extend the counter window or buff counter damage. Slowest
  dodge roll of any build but highest damage ceiling when
  playing reactively. Rewards reading enemy patterns.

-- SWORDMAGE --
  Totem:   Infusion totems
  Weapons: Sword, Staff
  Mid-combat weapon infusion — totem skill temporarily coats
  a melee weapon with a magic element (fire, frost, void,
  etc.), changing its passive trait and adding elemental
  damage for a limited time. Swapping totems mid-fight changes
  what infusion is available. High skill ceiling, strong burst
  windows.

-- SUMMONER --
  Totem:   Bond totems
  Weapons: Staff, any
  Finds eggs and cores hidden throughout the world. Eggs hatch
  into permanent companions with their own AI, health pool,
  and loose level scaling. Max 2 permanent companions.
  Permanent companions are permadeath — losing one is a
  meaningful setback, they do not respawn.
  Bond totems also unlock temporary companions on a time limit,
  with no cap on how many can be active. Temp companions act
  as fodder and distraction. Weakest solo early, strongest in
  sustained fights mid to late game.

-- ARCHER --
  Totem:   Quiver totems, sight totems
  Weapons: Bow
  Pure ranged. Totem skills add effects to arrows — pierce,
  split shot, elemental coating, trap arrows. Drawing the bow
  drains stamina so resource management is critical. Sight
  totems extend range and reduce sway. Weakest in enclosed
  spaces, devastating in open terrain and the Aether.

-- CLERIC --
  Totem:   Blessing totems, ward totems
  Weapons: Staff, Mace
  Team support anchor. Carries Revival Tokens found in the
  world to revive dead teammates, bypassing the corpse beacon.
  Ward totems place damage-absorbing fields. Blessing totems
  buff nearby allies' sanity and stamina regen. Solo Cleric is
  viable but slower — pays off heavily in server groups.

-- APOTHECARY --
  Totem:   Brew totems
  Weapons: Dagger, any
  Field alchemist. Brew totems unlock on-the-fly splash potion
  crafting from carried ingredients — no workbench needed.
  Potions heal, poison, disorient, slow, or apply elemental
  effects to a target area. The only build with reliable AoE
  damage outside of magic. Strong sanity tools. Weak in direct
  melee but excellent at controlling a fight's tempo.

-- MONK --
  Totem:   Discipline totems
  Weapons: Spear, Fists (unarmed — highest base attack speed)
  The only build with a unique resource meter: the DISCIPLINE
  METER. Fills by landing hits and successfully parrying.
  Spent to instantly clear sanity buildup or trigger a heal.
  Cannot be used offensively — purely a survival resource.
  A Monk who whiffs and eats hits bleeds the meter dry.
  Pairs best with high attack speed weapons to fill quickly.

----------------------------------------------------------------
CORE MECHANICS
----------------------------------------------------------------

COMBAT
  - All attacks have start lag and end lag, tuned per weapon
    and active totems.
  - Parry window is tight — skill rewarded, not spam.
  - Dodge roll has I-frames. Rogue builds get longer rolls and
    longer I-frames via the Shade Totem.
  - Stamina gates sprinting, dodging, and heavy attacks.

DEATH & CORPSE SYSTEM
  - On death, your corpse becomes an Undead Knight.
  - A beacon spawns at your death location.
  - You respawn with nothing — bare hands.
  - To recover your items, find the beacon and slay your old
    corpse.
  - On a multiplayer server, if another player kills your
    Undead Knight first, they get your loot.

SURVIVAL METERS
  - Hunger & Thirst — deplete over time. At low levels they
    drain stamina and sanity.
  - Stamina — governs dodges, sprints, and heavy attacks.
    Regenerates out of combat.
  - Sanity — drains in dark areas and caves, and on certain
    hits. At 0% a Corruption Event triggers.

CORRUPTION EVENT
  When sanity hits 0%:
    - Mobs aggro from farther away.
    - Phantom enemies appear that deal real damage.
    - HUD and audio distort.
  Reset sanity by eating specific foods, using Cleric totems,
  or sleeping.

----------------------------------------------------------------
MOBS
----------------------------------------------------------------

WYVERN
  A weaker cousin of the dragon. Dives and swoops to attack.
  To stun it, build or place a wall in its flight path, then
  attack while it's grounded.
  Drops: Wyvern Wing (needed to craft the glide item).
  Spawns: Open overworld and cliff areas.

UNDEAD KNIGHT
  Rare but dangerous. Can parry and dodge the player's attacks.
  Spawns weaker undead mobs around it as protection.
  Scales with player level.
  Drops: High-tier loot.
  Note: Your death corpse becomes a version of this.

HEADCRAWLER (name pending)
  A fast, erratic creature that lunges without warning.
  Low health but deals sanity damage on hit.
  Spawns alone in caves.
  Purpose: Makes caves feel unsafe even at high level.

----------------------------------------------------------------
PROGRESSION
----------------------------------------------------------------

== OVERWORLD ==
The starting layer. Familiar but deceptively dangerous.

  1. Bare Hands — punch trees, gather flint
  2. Flint Tools — basic axe, knife, small game hunting
  3. Stone Tools — full early kit, build shelter
  4. First Minor Boss — field guardian or corrupted beast;
     drops a key crafting material
  5. First Workbench — unlocks mid-tier recipes
  6. Iron-Equivalent Tools — better weapons and gathering
  7. First Overworld Dungeon — structured encounters,
     mini-bosses, first totem exposure
  8. First Forge — unlocks weapon smithing and alloys
  9. First Alloy — stronger than iron
 10. Caves unlocked

== CAVES ==
Dark, claustrophobic, resource-rich. Sanity drains faster here.

  - Headcrawlers make early caves dangerous
  - New ore tiers found only underground
  - Second Workbench tier found inside cave dungeon
  - Cave Boss — drops a crafting material and reveals the
    Aether Structure location on the map
  - Deeper caves have bioluminescent zones with unique
    crafting materials
  - Second Forge tier — unlocks advanced alloys

== AETHER ==
A sky realm. Floaty, bright, deceptively peaceful.
Platforms drift and shift. Gravity is reduced.

  - Activate by finding and powering the Aether Structure
    (revealed after clearing the Cave dungeon)
  - Dodge rolls go farther, falls are slower
  - Wyvern variants are common here — the Wyvern Wing glider
    is near-mandatory
  - Aether Dungeon has a vertical layout requiring gliding
    and platforming skill
  - Aether-exclusive totems drop here — highest sanity buffs
    in the game

  THE CELESTIAL LOCK (Aether Gate into the Final Dimension):

  Boss 1 — The Aether Warden
    A massive aerial guardian. Standard weapons work here.
    On death it drops the AETHER CORE.

  Crafting the Gate Weapons
    Take the Aether Core to the Aether Forge.
    It splits into 3 weapons:

      Skyblade        — melee, fast, bonus damage on aerial
                        targets. Suits Knight / Monk / Rogue.
      Starcaller Bow  — ranged, arrows pierce multiple enemies.
                        Suits Archer.
      Voidweave Staff — magic catalyst, enables full-power
                        spellcasting. Suits Summoner /
                        Swordmage / Cleric.

    Apothecary builds support whoever wields the three weapons
    rather than needing a gate weapon themselves.

  Boss 2 — The Final Sentinel
    Sits at the threshold between the Aether and the Final
    Dimension. Completely immune to everything EXCEPT the three
    gate weapons. No chip damage, no totem effects, no magic
    not cast through the Voidweave Staff.

    Forces server groups to coordinate across all three
    archetypes. Solo players must craft all three and
    weapon-swap mid-fight.

    Drops: VOID SHARD — activates the Final Dimension structure.

== FINAL DIMENSION (name TBD) ==
The endgame. Alien, hostile, visually distinct from everything
prior.

  - Sanity drains constantly — Cleric and Apothecary shine here
  - All previous mob types appear as corrupted variants
  - Final Dungeon — the longest in the game, designed for a
    server group
  - Final Boss — drops end-game materials and triggers the
    win condition

  WIN CONDITION:
    Craft the AETHERIC CORE and place it at the world's spawn
    point. This permanently stabilizes the corruption for that
    server. It's a server-wide event — everyone benefits or
    competes for it.

----------------------------------------------------------------
MULTIPLAYER
----------------------------------------------------------------
  - Persistent world servers (like Minecraft / Rust)
  - PvP or PvE server flags
  - Other players can loot your Undead Knight if they kill it
  - The Aetheric Core win condition affects the whole server
  - Sanity corruption events are local to each player

----------------------------------------------------------------
SIDE BOSSES
----------------------------------------------------------------

THE CASTLE DUNGEON & THE FALLEN CAPTAIN
  Location: An abandoned castle found in the overworld,
  unrelated to main progression. The castle exterior is its
  own mini-dungeon — standard undead enemies throughout.
  Clearing the castle opens a door into a lower dungeon level
  beneath it, which terminates in the Fallen Captain.

  The Fallen Captain is a side boss. He is not required for
  any crafting gate or progression unlock. Players who want
  the Montante blueprint will seek him out; Archers,
  Apothecaries, and Summoners can skip him entirely without
  missing anything critical.

  PHASE 1 — Unarmed
    The Captain fights with bare hands, parrying with an open
    palm. His parry only covers frontal attacks — circling
    pressure or attacking immediately after his own swing
    (during his end lag) bypasses it entirely. He will not
    attack during his parry stance, so it can also be baited:
    fake a swing, wait for his guard to rise, then commit.
    His parry stance has a readable tell — a subtle weight
    shift and guard raise animation that players will learn
    to recognise over repeated attempts.

    Against ranged players: he telegraphs his dodge with a
    visible backward step. Arrows fired into that step will
    miss. Wait for him to land and punish the recovery frame.

    Phase 1 ends when his health drops to roughly half.

  PHASE 2 — Montante
    He steps back, heals partially, and draws a Montante
    one-handed — implying a level of skill that makes two
    hands unnecessary. The shift changes the fight dynamic
    entirely. In Phase 1 he was the defensive wall. In Phase
    2 he becomes the aggressor.

    The Montante has longer reach than players will expect
    from a one-handed grip. His swings are slower than Phase
    1's hand strikes but carry significant end-lag bait —
    the timing is designed to punish players who parry too
    early. His own parry rate drops in Phase 2 because he
    is now committed to pressing the attack rather than
    reading the player.

    Interrupting his Phase 2 heal during the wind-up
    animation cancels it — rewards aggressive play but is
    not required to win.

  EXPLOIT (readable across both phases):
    The parry stance tell is consistent in both phases.
    During the guard raise animation he will never initiate
    an attack, making it a reliable bait window. Players
    who learn this in Phase 1 carry that knowledge into
    Phase 2 without the mechanic being re-explained.

  Drops:
    - Montante Blueprint — unlocks the Montante as a
      forgeable two-handed weapon. High base damage, slower
      attack speed, long reach. Suits Knight, Monk, and
      Swordmage builds best.
    - High-tier loot (standard undead drop pool, elevated
      quality).

  Notes:
    - The Montante the Captain wields in Phase 2 is not
      lootable directly — the Blueprint must be taken to a
      Forge to craft one.
    - The castle itself can be used as a player shelter after
      clearing — doors can be secured, making it one of the
      better defensible structures in the overworld.

----------------------------------------------------------------
WEAPON FORGING SYSTEM
----------------------------------------------------------------

THE PROCESS
  Ores are smelted into liquid at a forge and poured into part
  casts. Casts are molds for specific weapon parts — find or
  unlock the cast pattern, fill it with molten material, and
  assemble the parts into a finished weapon.

  Higher tier ores require higher tier forges to smelt. You
  cannot cheat progression by carrying ore forward — the forge
  is the gate, not the ore.

FORGE TIERS
  Tier 1 (Overworld, early)       — smelts Overworld Groups 1 & 2
  Tier 2 (Overworld, post-dungeon)— smelts Overworld Group 3
                                    and Cave Group 1
  Tier 3 (Caves)                  — smelts Cave Groups 2 & 3
                                    and Aether Group 1
  Tier 4 (Aether)                 — smelts Aether Groups 2 & 3
                                    and Final Dimension ores

WEAPON PARTS BY TYPE
  Each part is cast separately and contributes its own stats.

  Sword     — Blade, Guard, Handle
  Bow       — Limbs, Grip, String Anchor
  Staff     — Focus Gem, Shaft, Base
  Axe       — Head, Beard, Handle
  Dagger    — Blade, Grip (2 parts, simplest weapon)
  Spear     — Head, Pole, Butt Cap
  Montante  — Blade, Cross Guard, Grip, Pommel (4 parts,
               two-handed, longest weapon in the game)

WHAT PARTS CONTRIBUTE
  Every part pulls from its material's stat pool:

  Durability           — how long before the weapon needs repair
  Attack Speed         — affects start and end lag
  Passive Trait        — a single passive effect tied to the ore
  Synergy Bonus        — if two or more parts share the same ore
                         GROUP (not the same ore), a bonus trait
                         activates on top of individual stats

  Synergy rewards mixing within a group without forcing one
  correct combo. Two different ores from the same group will
  always synergize. Two ores from different groups never will.

ORE GROUPS
  Groups within the same dimension are lateral — no best option,
  just different strengths and traits. Groups in higher
  dimensions are strictly stronger than those below.

  -- OVERWORLD --

  Group 1 (early)
    Ashfen    — high durability, trait: minor lifesteal
    Greyveil  — balanced stats, trait: slow on hit

  Group 2 (mid)
    Duskram   — high attack speed, trait: bleed on hit
    Emberrak  — high durability, trait: stamina cost reduction

  Group 3 (late)
    Scorvite  — very high attack speed, trait: burn on hit
    Thornvel  — very high durability, trait: extended bleed

  -- CAVES --

  Group 1
    Murkvein  — high durability, trait: blindness on hit
    Gloomite  — high attack speed, trait: sanity drain aura

  Group 2
    Vaulmar   — balanced, trait: echo damage (delayed 2nd hit)
    Hollowfen — high durability, trait: lifesteal

  Group 3
    Abyssram  — high attack speed, trait: fear on hit
    Cryptveil — high durability, trait: stacking poison

  -- AETHER --

    Driftfen  — high attack speed, trait: float on kill
    Veilstone — high durability, trait: reduced fall damage

  Group 2
    Stormveil — balanced, trait: chain lightning on hit
    Skyvein   — high attack speed, trait: aerial damage bonus

  Group 3
    Solenvite — high attack speed, trait: sanity restore on kill
    Voidglass — high durability, trait: damage scales with height

  -- FINAL DIMENSION --

  Group 1
    Corrveil  — high attack speed, trait: corruption burst
    Ashvoid   — high durability, trait: health drain aura

  Group 2
    Voidheart — balanced, trait: nullify enemy passive on hit
    Nullvite  — high attack speed, trait: stamina refill on kill

  Group 3 (endgame)
    Aethramite — high durability, trait: all damage types at once
    Voidram    — high attack speed, trait: instant kill threshold

SYNERGY EXAMPLE
  Sword with Ashfen Blade + Ashfen Guard + Greyveil Handle:
    Each part gives its individual trait, PLUS the Group 1
    overworld synergy bonus activates — e.g. 10% chance to
    trigger all three traits simultaneously on a hit.

  Swap the Guard for a Duskram Guard (Group 2):
    No synergy. But you gain bleed on hit from the Guard slot,
    which may suit your build better. Neither is wrong.

----------------------------------------------------------------
TOTEM LIST
----------------------------------------------------------------

RULES
  - Each totem slot has a dedicated keybind for its active.
  - Totems with no active are purely stat or passive.
  - Equipping two of the same totem causes conflict — only one
    applies. Use the slot for something else.
  - Any build can equip any totem. Stats always apply fully
    regardless of build. Dead passives/actives are a trade-off
    the player accepts.

-- SHADE TOTEMS --

  Shade Totem
    Passive: Disables parry entirely. Dodge rolls travel farther
    and have longer I-frames than any other build.
    Stat: +dodge distance.

  Veil Totem
    Passive: Landing a dodge roll within melee range of an enemy
    briefly turns you translucent, reducing their aggro
    re-acquisition window by ~0.5s.
    Stat: +dodge speed.

  Wraith Totem
    Active: Enter a short invisibility (3-4s). Breaks on attack.
    Long cooldown.
    Stat: +movement speed.

-- SHIELD / COUNTER TOTEMS --

  Bulwark Totem
    Passive: Successful parries restore a small amount of stamina.

  Counter Totem
    Passive: Extends the counter-attack window after a successful
    parry by a fixed number of frames.
    Stat: +counter damage.

  Ironwall Totem
    Active: Shield bash — interrupts an enemy attack mid-animation
    and staggers them, opening a counter window.
    Stat: +physical damage reduction.

-- INFUSION TOTEMS --

  Ember Totem
    Active: Coats your melee weapon in fire for 10s. Adds burn
    on hit and temporarily changes its passive trait.
    Stat: +elemental damage.

  Frost Totem
    Active: Coats weapon in frost. Hits slow enemy movement for
    the duration.
    Stat: +attack reach.

  Void Totem
    Active: Coats weapon in void energy. Hits briefly reduce
    the target's damage output.
    Stat: +skill cooldown reduction.

-- BOND TOTEMS --

  Hatch Totem
    Passive: Eggs found in the world incubate faster while
    equipped. Required to raise permanent companions.
    Stat: +companion health.

  Leash Totem
    Active: Command all active temporary companions to focus
    a single target simultaneously.
    Stat: +temporary companion duration.

  Soulbond Totem
    Passive: When a permanent companion takes lethal damage,
    they instead survive at 1hp once per encounter.
    Stat: +permanent companion damage.

  Pierce Totem
    Passive: Arrows penetrate through the first enemy hit
    and continue.
    Stat: +arrow damage.

  Split Totem
    Active: Next arrow fired splits into three on release.
    Short cooldown.
    Stat: +projectile speed.

  Trap Totem
    Active: Fire a trap arrow that embeds in a surface and
    triggers on enemy proximity.
    Stat: +stamina regen while bow is drawn.

-- SIGHT TOTEMS --

  Farsight Totem
    Passive: Reduces bow sway at full draw.
    Stat: +effective range.

  Hunter Totem
    Passive: Enemies briefly show a weak point indicator
    after completing an attack animation.
    Stat: +crit damage.

  Mark Totem
    Active: Mark a target — all damage dealt to that target
    is increased for 8s.
    Stat: +perception range (aggro awareness).

-- BLESSING TOTEMS --

  Mend Totem
    Active: Pulse a small heal to yourself and nearby allies.
    Stat: +healing effectiveness.

  Vigil Totem
    Passive: Allies within range have slightly accelerated
    sanity regen.
    Stat: +sanity cap.

  Grace Totem
    Passive: Reviving a teammate with a Revival Token leaves
    them with a brief damage reduction buff on respawn.
    Stat: +Revival Token use speed.

-- WARD TOTEMS --

  Barrier Totem
    Active: Place a damage-absorbing field at your location.
    Absorbs a fixed amount before breaking.

    ingredients without opening the crafting menu.
    Stat: +potion potency.

  Splash Totem
    Passive: Thrown potions have a larger area of effect.
    Stat: +ingredient carry capacity.

    Stat: +poison damage.

-- DISCIPLINE TOTEMS --

  Focus Totem
    Passive: Discipline meter fills faster on successful
    parries specifically.
    Stat: +discipline meter cap.

  Endure Totem
    Passive: Spending discipline for a heal restores more
    health than base.
    Stat: +health regen rate.

  Strike Totem
    Passive: Every 5 consecutive hits without taking damage
    grants a brief attack speed boost.
    Stat: +unarmed damage.

NOTABLE CROSS-BUILD INTERACTIONS
  Mark Totem + Apothecary — mark a target then splash them
  with a potion. The damage amplification stacks with potion
  AoE. Unintended but valid.

  Pierce Totem on Knight — stat bonus applies, passive is
  dead without a bow. Worth it only if the stamina or damage
  stat outweighs using that slot for Counter Totem.

  Soulbond Totem on non-Summoner — purely a stat stick.
  The passive does nothing. Take it if the stats suit the
  build and you have a spare slot.

  Wraith Totem on Rogue — pairs with Shade Totem's extended
  I-frames. Invisible approach into a dodge-through attack
  is a high-skill opener that no other build replicates.

----------------------------------------------------------------
LORE FRAMEWORK — THE TRUE NATURE OF THE WORLD
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is design-internal context. It is never stated to the
player directly. Players reconstruct it through environmental
storytelling, item descriptions, boss arenas, and notes left
by Aethon's civilization. The community is expected to piece
it together collectively over time, ARG-style.

THE CORE TRUTH
  The world is a living organism. Not metaphorically — it
  has an immune system. Humanity is not native to it. Whether
  humanity arrived, evolved incorrectly, or was placed here
  is deliberately left unanswered. What matters is that
  human activity — mining, forging, dimensional travel,
  large-scale construction — crosses thresholds the world
  registers as damage. Below those thresholds, humanity is
  tolerated. Above them, the immune response activates.

  The corruption is not evil. It is biological. The undead,
  the headcrawlers, the sanity drain, the phantom spawns
  during Corruption Events — all of it is the world's
  low-level response to human presence. Not punishment.
  Antibodies.

  The Wound is what the immune system becomes when the
  low-level response fails. It has done this before. Aethon
  was not the first civilization to cross the threshold.
  They were simply the most recent, and the most thorough
  in their destruction.

  The Crow is not subject to the immune response in the
  same way. The world does not register crow biology as
  damage. This is why the Order of the Hollow Wing used
  it as a foundation — the Crow can go where humans
  cannot, carry what humans cannot deliver, and activate
  the counter-frequency at the source without being
  consumed before arrival. The world tolerates the Crow
  not out of recognition but out of the same indifference
  it shows to its own native fauna. The Crow is close
  enough to native that the distinction is below the
  threshold of response.

  Whether that changes after the ending is unanswered.

THE ORDER OF THE HOLLOW WING
  The only human organization in the current civilization
  to correctly interpret Aethon's ruins. They understood
  the threshold, understood the immune response, and
  understood that the kingdom's activity was approaching
  the same breaking point Aethon reached. They were not
  public. They operated in margins, safehouses, and
  coded correspondence. Whether the kingdom destroyed
  them for what they knew or whether they simply died
  out over the long wait for their creation to awaken
  is deliberately unresolved.

  Their notes are warmer in tone than Aethon's clinical
  records — personal, occasionally argued, written by
  people who disagreed with each other about methods
  and timelines while agreeing completely on the problem.
  The internal disagreements are part of the lore.
  Some Order members believed the Crow should be told
  everything from the moment of awakening. Others
  believed the discovery had to be organic or the
  Crow would not trust it. The organic faction won.
  This is why the Crow wakes knowing nothing.

  Their sigil is a crow in flight. It appears on all
  Order materials. No member explains the choice in
  any surviving document. By the time a player has
  read everything, the explanation is unnecessary.

AETHON
  The civilization that built the Aether structures, the
  dimensional forges, the gates. They were not evil. They
  were curious, industrious, and completely oblivious to
  what their work was doing to the world beneath them.
  Their notes read as proud, methodical, and increasingly
  confused in the final entries. They detected the world's
  response and interpreted it as a natural phenomenon to
  be studied rather than a warning to be heeded.

  They never understood what they did wrong. The Wound
  consumed them before the understanding could arrive.
  Their ruins are everywhere. Their notes are the primary
  lore delivery mechanism. Reading them in sequence — if
  a player can find them all — tells the complete story
  of a civilization that built magnificently and died
  without ever knowing why.

  The final Aethon note, found in the Observatory in the
  Aether, reads: "it appears to be a response — we have
  not determined what to." There is no entry after this.

THE ENDING
  Placing the Aetheric Core ends the Wound's active
  phase. The corruption stops spreading. The Aether
  collapses. All dimensional access closes permanently.
  The sky carries the scar of its absence from that
  point forward — a visible void above the cloud layer
  where the Aether used to glow, present from anywhere
  in the world on a clear day. Players who never
  reached the Aether will notice the sky changed
  without knowing what was there. Players who cleared
  the Aether Dungeon will know exactly what they are
  looking at every time they look up.

  Nobody acknowledges what the Crow did. The world
  continues. The game continues. The win condition
  logs as a server milestone and that is the full
  extent of the world's formal recognition.

  Over the hours and days following activation,
  natural crows gather at the Core placement site
  and remain. They do not behave unusually. They
  simply arrive and stay, in growing numbers, with
  no explanation given anywhere in the game. The
  Order's sigil was a crow in flight. The Order is
  gone. The crows remain. What that means is left
  entirely to the player.

  The final readable item is authored by no
  identifiable source, in no writing system that
  appears elsewhere, rendered in the player's
  language without explanation: "the readings
  have stabilized. the anomaly has accepted
  containment. we are logging this as a success."

  The Wound kept records. It always watched. It
  considered this outcome a success too. Whether
  "the anomaly" refers to humanity, the Wound's
  active phase, the Crow, or all three at once
  is left entirely to the player.

  The Crow keeps playing. The world is still here.
  It just no longer needs them. What that implies
  about the next cycle is left unwritten.

----------------------------------------------------------------
POINTS OF INTEREST
----------------------------------------------------------------

Points of interest are unmarkered. No quest indicators, no
map pins. Players find them by exploring or following
community knowledge. Each one contains at minimum one
readable note, one environmental story, and one reason
to have come.

The environmental damage POIs exist to plant seeds of the
true lore without stating it. A player who visits all of
them before the final boss will have everything they need
to understand what The Wound is. A player who skips them
will understand it only in retrospect, or not at all.

== OVERWORLD POIs ==

  THE ASHFIELDS
    A vast stretch of dead farmland southeast of the starting
    area, visible from a distance as a black scar on the
    landscape. Crops were grown here using cave minerals as
    fertilizer — Aethon agricultural records describe yields
    so extraordinary they were considered a miracle. The soil
    is now black, dry, and cracked in hexagonal plates. Nothing
    grows. The water table beneath it is gone.

    The farmhouse at the center is intact. Plates are still
    on the table. The final journal entry from the farmer
    describes the third consecutive miracle harvest and plans
    to expand into the adjacent valley. There is no entry
    that describes anything going wrong. It happened too fast.

    Headcrawlers nest here in large numbers — they are drawn
    to dead earth. The density here is higher than anywhere
    else in the overworld, making the Ashfields dangerous
    even for mid-progression players.

    Environmental detail: the tree line stops abruptly at
    the field boundary, as if the death has a border it
    hasn't crossed yet. The border is slowly expanding.
    Players who visit early and revisit late will notice it
    has moved.

  THE LOGGED VALE
    A valley west of the first overworld dungeon where every
    tree has been felled. The stumps are old — this happened
    long before the player arrived. The river that ran through
    the vale has changed course entirely, carving new channels
    through the exposed topsoil. The original riverbed is dry
    and cracked.

    A sawmill sits half-collapsed at the valley floor. The
    machinery is Aethon-era. Inside, production ledgers
    detail quotas and shipment schedules in precise numerical
    language — the same clinical tone as the Observatory
    notes. The final entry is not a conclusion, just a number.
    The next line is blank. Shipments simply stopped.

    The new river channels have created a series of unstable
    mudflats at the valley exit. Players traversing on foot
    risk sinking. A body is visible in one of the deeper
    patches, half-submerged, carrying a mid-tier ore cache
    on its person — reachable with careful pathfinding.

    No hostile mobs spawn here. The vale is simply dead and
    quiet. The silence is the point.

  THE OPEN PIT
    Visible from the ridgeline above it as a wound in the
    earth — a mine so large and so deep that it has begun
    to collapse inward at the edges. The surrounding land
    has subsided in concentric rings, cracking the surface
    in lines that radiate outward like a shatter pattern.
    Several trees on the rim have tilted inward at steep
    angles, roots partially exposed.

    Ladders descend into the pit in sections. The bottom
    is not accessible — a collapse has sealed the lowest
    level. But the accessible tiers contain remnant ore
    deposits that were missed in the original extraction,
    making the descent worth the risk for resource-focused
    players.

    A small settlement at the pit rim was abandoned mid-meal.
    Plates on tables, tools leaning against walls, a child's
    toy on the floor of one structure. No bodies. No sign of
    violence. Whatever made them leave, they left quickly and
    they did not come back. One note pinned to the settlement
    noticeboard reads: "do not go near the eastern ring.
    the ground sounds wrong." It is not signed.

    The eastern ring has since collapsed entirely.

  ABANDONED APOTHECARY HUT
    A small structure deep in the forest, overgrown but
    structurally intact. The previous occupant was clearly
    a skilled herbalist — ingredient stockpiles line the
    walls in labeled clay jars, most still usable. Brew
    totem schematics are pinned above the workbench,
    hand-annotated with personal notes about potency and
    timing.

    The occupant's journal describes years of careful
    foraging and experimentation. The final entries describe
    a change in the local plant life — certain herbs growing
    wrong, producing effects they shouldn't. The occupant
    was excited. They thought they had discovered something
    new. The journal ends mid-sentence in a recipe notation.

    The ingredient stockpile makes this a high-value early
    find for Apothecary builds. The schematic notes function
    as a soft tutorial for brew mechanics. The journal is
    pure lore — the herbs growing wrong are an early hint
    at the world's changing chemistry, though no player
    will recognize it as such on first read.

  STANDING STONES
    Seven stones arranged in a rough circle in an open field,
    each roughly twice human height. No Aethon markings —
    these predate Aethon entirely and no notes explain them.
    They are simply there.

    Players who stand within the circle find their sanity
    regen rate significantly increased. No visual effect,
    no sound cue, no explanation. The stones do not appear
    in any note or journal found elsewhere in the world.
    They simply work.

    The implication — that something older than Aethon
    understood the world well enough to build sanity anchors
    into the landscape — is left entirely to the player.

  RUINED WATCHTOWER
    A collapsed tower on a cliff overlooking a valley,
    reachable by a narrow path that most players will
    miss on a first pass. The top two floors have fallen
    but the base is stable. An Undead Knight patrols the
    interior — better equipped than standard field variants,
    carrying a mid-tier sword the player can recover from
    the corpse.

    A logbook at the base describes the tower's original
    purpose: watching for movement from the eastern
    territory. The final entries describe something moving
    at night that didn't match any known creature. The
    watchmen sent a runner for reinforcements. The runner
    apparently never arrived. The logbook ends.

    The cliff view from the top of the accessible floors
    is the best vantage point in the early overworld —
    players can see the Logged Vale, the edge of the
    Ashfields, and the distant mountain range concealing
    the cave entrance from a single position.

  BANDIT CAMP
    A functioning camp of human survivors who have chosen
    hostility over cooperation. Not undead, not corrupted —
    just people who decided that aggression was the better
    survival strategy. They attack on sight.

    The camp has a central fire, several tents, a locked
    chest requiring a key carried by the camp leader, and
    a prisoner in a cage who will trade information for
    release. The information varies — cave entrance
    locations, structure positions, general world knowledge
    — making the camp worth clearing even without the
    chest contents.

    A note in the leader's tent describes their original
    group of eleven. They are now six. The note does not
    explain what happened to the other five.

  MERCHANT CARAVAN WRECKAGE
    The remains of a trading convoy on a road that no
    longer leads anywhere useful. Several wagons, most
    overturned. Scattered goods across a wide area, some
    still in usable condition. One wagon is intact and
    locked — the key is on a body twenty meters into
    the treeline, as if someone tried to run.

    A single survivor sits at the intact wagon. He does
    not explain what happened to the others and deflects
    direct questions. He trades — mid-tier goods for
    materials, prices fair. He is not a quest giver.
    He has no name given to the player. He simply exists
    here and trades, and if players return to the wreckage
    later in progression he is gone and the wagon is
    finally open, containing high-tier goods and a note
    in handwriting that matches nothing else in the world.

    What the note says is left to final writing.

== CAVE POIs ==

  THE POISONED VEIN
    An underground river that Aethon's civilization
    diverted centuries ago to power a series of
    deep-level forges. The diversion was never reversed.
    The water runs the wrong color — not dramatically,
    not a vivid green or red, just slightly off. Players
    who look at it long enough will feel uncertain whether
    they're seeing it correctly.

    The fish in the river are wrong-shaped. Not grotesquely
    — subtly. Fins in positions that are almost correct.
    Eyes slightly too large. They are alive and they
    behave normally except that they do not flee from
    the player.

    Bioluminescent zones adjacent to the Poisoned Vein
    have been bleached out entirely. The fungi that
    produce the light are present but no longer luminescent.
    The section of cave around the Vein is consequently
    darker than surrounding areas.

    An Aethon engineer's journal found at the diversion
    point describes the project with considerable pride.
    Precise measurements, projected output figures,
    a note about the commendation the team expects to
    receive. No follow-up entry about what the river
    looked like a year later.

  THE EXCAVATION
    The deepest accessible point in the cave system —
    reaching it requires significant vertical descent
    through increasingly hostile territory. The dig
    site is Aethon-era, massive in scale, clearly the
    work of a dedicated long-term operation. The equipment
    is still present, frozen in mid-use.

    Notes accumulate as players descend through the site.
    The upper levels describe a routine mining operation.
    Mid-levels describe an unexpected discovery — a
    formation that doesn't match any known geology.
    The language becomes more excited, less precise.
    Lower levels describe readings that "should be
    impossible" and the decision to send a second team
    to confirm.

    The lowest accessible level contains the second team's
    equipment. No second team. The final note, written in
    a different hand from all preceding entries, contains
    only coordinates and the word "underneath."

    The coordinates, if players attempt to cross-reference
    them, point to a location inside solid rock that should
    not be accessible. Whether something is there is left
    to level design.

  BIOLUMINESCENT GROTTO
    A large cave chamber where the fungi and mineral
    formations produce enough light to see clearly without
    torches. No hostile mobs spawn here — the space is
    genuinely safe. Sanity actively recovers inside it
    rather than draining, at a rate faster than sleeping.

    The grotto is a reward for deep exploration. Players
    who find it have a reliable sanity reset point that
    doesn't require food, sleep, or totem use. In a game
    where the caves are hostile and dark, a safe glowing
    room is a significant discovery.

    No notes. No lore. No explanation for why this place
    is safe when nothing else down here is. The standing
    stones in the overworld have the same absence of
    explanation. Players who notice the pattern will
    draw their own conclusions.

  FLOODED MINE
    A partially operational mine where a lower section
    has flooded, creating a pool of still black water
    of uncertain depth. The accessible dry sections
    contain mid-tier ore deposits. The flooded section
    contains something visible at the bottom — a light
    source, consistent and unmoving, too deep to reach
    by swimming from the surface.

    Headcrawlers are more aggressive near the water.
    They do not enter it but they cluster at its edge
    in higher numbers than elsewhere in the caves,
    facing inward. They do not attack each other. They
    do not move unless the player approaches.

    Reaching the light at the bottom requires either
    specific equipment or creative problem-solving left
    to player discovery. What the light source is is
    left to final design.

  ANCIENT VAULT
    A sealed door deep in the cave system, visually
    distinct from Aethon architecture — older, different
    materials, different construction language entirely.
    The door requires a key that is not found in the
    vault's immediate area.

    The key is in the Excavation site, on the person
    of the second team's expedition leader — who is
    not present at the Excavation but whose body is
    findable elsewhere in the cave system if players
    search thoroughly.

    Inside the vault: no boss, no combat encounter.
    A high-tier ore cache, a pre-Aethon artifact of
    unclear purpose that functions as a mid-tier totem
    when equipped, and a single wall inscription in
    a script that does not match Aethon's writing system.
    No translation is provided anywhere in the game.

  MUSHROOM FOREST
    A large cave biome where the ceiling is high enough
    that the fungi have grown to tree scale — caps
    three to four meters across, stalks climbable with
    careful movement. The light they produce is dim
    and shifts color slowly.

    Foraging ingredients concentrated here are usable
    in Apothecary brew recipes and provide effects not
    achievable with surface ingredients. A headcrawler
    den occupies the deepest section of the forest,
    making thorough foraging a risk calculation.

    No Aethon presence here. No notes, no equipment.
    The mushroom forest predates their civilization.
    Whether this is significant is left unstated.

== AETHER POIs ==

  THE ANCHOR SCARS
    Points in the Aether where Aethon physically tethered
    floating platforms to stabilize them for construction.
    The anchors are still in place — massive metal spires
    driven through the platforms and into whatever is
    below the Aether. The platforms around each anchor
    are cracked and listing, the geometry warped in ways
    that affect movement and gliding near them.

    Gravity behaves inconsistently within a radius of
    each scar. Not dangerously — just wrongly. Falls
    that should be fast are slow. Jumps that should
    arc normally don't. The Wyvern Wing glider produces
    unexpected results near the anchors.

    Aethon structural notes at each site describe the
    anchoring process as an engineering triumph. The
    final note at the largest scar site, written by
    a different author, describes vibrations in the
    anchor that weren't there during installation.
    The author recommends investigation. There is no
    record of investigation occurring.

  THE OBSERVATORY
    An Aethon facility on a large stable platform near
    the Aether's upper limit. The equipment inside is
    still running — power source unknown, still active
    after Aethon's collapse. The readings it outputs
    are the same waveform pattern as the corruption.

    Notes in the Observatory span the full arc of
    Aethon's discovery. Early entries describe anomalous
    dimensional readings with scientific excitement.
    Mid-period entries describe the readings intensifying
    in correlation with Aethon's construction output.
    The correlation is noted but not interpreted correctly
    — the researchers conclude the dimensional activity
    is causing the readings, rather than the readings
    being a response to the dimensional activity.

    The final entry: "it appears to be a response — we
    have not determined what to." No entry follows.

    The Observatory is the single location in the game
    where the full truth is closest to explicit. Players
    who reach it and read every note in sequence will
    have most of the picture. The final connection —
    that the response was to humanity itself, not to
    dimensional technology specifically — is never
    written down anywhere. It is the inference players
    are meant to make.

  CRASHED SKYSHIP
    A large Aethon vessel wrecked on a drifting platform,
    listing at a steep angle, partially broken apart on
    impact. The cargo hold is accessible and contains
    mid-to-high tier materials, some Aethon-era equipment
    that functions as craftable blueprints, and a flight
    log that ends with a single anomalous entry.

    The final log entry describes something the crew
    observed through the viewport that the captain could
    not identify and declined to describe in writing
    on the grounds that the description would not be
    believed. Course correction was initiated. Impact
    followed two entries later.

    The wreck is large enough to function as a temporary
    shelter. Players can secure sections of it and use
    it as a base, though the platform it rests on drifts
    and its position relative to other landmarks shifts
    over time.

  SKY MONASTERY
    A structure built by a sect of Aethon who believed
    the Aether itself was sacred and who attempted to
    live in harmony with it rather than exploit it.
    Their notes are the warmest human writing in the
    game — careful, observational, interested in the
    Aether as a place rather than a resource.

    They were still consumed. The Wound made no
    distinction between the sect and the civilization
    that surrounded them. Their final entries describe
    watching Aethon's collapse from a distance and
    understanding, too late, that proximity was enough.

    The monastery contains the highest concentration
    of Cleric and Monk totems in the game. A complete
    set of Blessing Totem variants is findable here
    without fighting for them — the monastery is
    largely safe, its only enemies being Wyverns on
    the platform approaches.

    The sect's final note is the closest any Aethon
    source comes to understanding the truth: "we built
    too much. we asked too much of a place that was
    not ours to ask anything of. we are sorry. we do
    not know to whom we are apologizing."

  WYVERN NEST
    A cluster of three large platforms close enough
    together that Wyverns use the gaps between them
    as hunting territory. Multiple Wyverns patrol
    simultaneously, making approach dangerous without
    a glider and combat space.

    The nest itself contains eggs. A Summoner with
    the Hatch Totem equipped can take an egg as a
    permanent companion candidate. The nest also
    contains Wyvern Wing materials in higher quantity
    than random Wyvern drops, making it worth the
    approach for non-Summoner builds.

    No lore here. The Wyverns predate Aethon and
    will outlast whatever comes next.

REQUIRED BOSSES
----------------------------------------------------------------

== OVERWORLD BOSS — ALDRIC, THE HOLLOW SOVEREIGN ==

  LORE
    Aldric was the last king of the largest human
    settlement in the overworld — a city whose ruins
    are now the first overworld dungeon. When the
    corruption reached his territory he did not flee.
    He believed that a king's will was sufficient to
    contain anything if the will was strong enough.
    He bound himself to the corruption deliberately,
    convinced that sheer refusal would turn it back.

    He was wrong. The corruption did not respond to
    will. It responded to biology, and his was no
    different from anyone else's. What remains of
    Aldric still wears the crown. Still issues orders
    to soldiers who have been dead for centuries.
    He wanders the ruins of his own capital in a
    loop, commanding a kingdom that no longer exists,
    unable to understand why no one follows his orders
    anymore.

    He is not evil. He is simply completely gone.
    Every item he drops has a description written
    as if authored by a court historian who didn't
    survive either.

  LOCATION
    The throne room at the base of the first overworld
    dungeon. Players clear through the dungeon — former
    palace structures, now haunted by undead soldiers —
    before reaching Aldric in what was once the great
    hall. The architecture is intact. The banquet table
    is still set. He is standing at the head of it.

  PHASE 1 — The Sovereign's Discipline
    Aldric fights with a royal greatsword and a decaying
    shield. His moveset is methodical, almost ceremonial —
    he fights the way someone trained to fight in armor
    for formal duels, not actual warfare. Every attack
    has a long wind-up and a clear recovery. He is not
    fast. He is reading the player, waiting for openings.

    The complication: phantom soldiers intercept the
    player's attacks. They manifest between Aldric and
    incoming strikes, absorbing damage before dissolving.
    They are not fully tangible — attacking through them
    is possible but the damage is split.

    The tell: Aldric's eyes track the phantom he intends
    to use before he uses it. His gaze shifts to a
    position before the phantom appears there. Players
    who watch his eyes rather than his weapon learn to
    predict interceptions and position around them.

    Parry-heavy builds will find Phase 1 manageable —
    his attacks are slow enough to read. Dodge-heavy
    builds can circle him faster than the phantoms
    can reposition.

  PHASE 2 — What's Left
    Triggered at roughly 50% health. The shield
    crumbles — it was already mostly corroded, Phase 1
    was hiding how little was left. The phantoms stop
    responding to him. He stands still for a moment,
    looking at where they were, and the fight pauses
    for roughly three seconds.

    Then he comes.

    Phase 2 Aldric is slower than Phase 1 but hits
    significantly harder. No phantoms, no tactical
    positioning — just grief expressed as violence.
    His attacks are no longer ceremonial. They are
    desperate. His parry window is gone. He does not
    defend himself anymore. He just swings.

    Players who were playing reactively in Phase 1
    need to adjust — he no longer gives them the
    recovery windows they were exploiting. He is
    trying to end the fight quickly even at the cost
    of taking damage.

  DROPS
    Sovereign Shard — a key crafting material for
    mid-tier weapon assembly. Item description reads:
    "recovered from the ruins of the Ashfen campaign.
    provenance uncertain. the crown is not included
    in the inventory."

    Aldric's Crown — a wearable item with no combat
    stats. Purely cosmetic. Item description reads:
    "it fits."

  NOTES FOR DESIGN
    The three-second pause at Phase 2 transition is
    intentional and must be preserved. It is the
    moment the player understands who they just broke.
    Do not fill it with sound or effects. Let it be
    quiet.

    The phantom interception mechanic must be tuned
    so that players who ignore the eye-tracking tell
    still eventually win — just less efficiently.
    The tell is a reward for observation, not a
    mandatory mechanic.

== CAVE BOSS — THE SEXTON ==

  LORE
    The caves are not natural. The deepest sections —
    below the bioluminescent zones, below the flooded
    mines — were dug. Aethon dug them, looking for
    something they had detected in their dimensional
    readings. They found it. The Excavation notes
    describe a discovery at the lowest level that
    the authors could not explain and declined to
    describe precisely.

    The Sexton found it first.

    He was a gravedigger by trade, hired by Aethon's
    excavation teams for the physical labor of the
    deep dig. When the teams were consumed he stayed.
    He has been down here ever since — tending to
    whatever is at the bottom, feeding it, keeping
    others away. Whether he is acting on compulsion
    or genuine devotion is impossible to determine
    from the outside.

    His body has partially merged with the cave wall
    in the sections he inhabits most frequently.
    The merge is not violent — it looks almost
    voluntary, like he leaned against the wall one
    day and simply kept going. He carries a mining
    pick that he swings one-handed as if it weighs
    nothing.

    His lore is deliberately incomplete. Players
    will not find notes that explain what he found
    or what he has been feeding. The Excavation
    notes point toward his discovery but do not
    reach it. What is at the bottom of the dig
    site is a question the game does not answer.

  LOCATION
    The lowest reachable point of the cave dungeon,
    in a chamber that opens unexpectedly after a
    section of tight tunnels. The ceiling is higher
    than it should be. The chamber feels wrong in
    scale — too large for where it is in the cave
    system, as if the space itself is not entirely
    natural.

  PHASE 1 — The Gardener
    The Sexton is partially embedded in the wall when
    players enter. He extracts himself as the fight
    begins — this takes several seconds and is not
    instant, giving players time to assess the arena.

    The arena is his garden — bodies half-embedded
    in the walls and floor in the same manner as
    his own partial merge. These are previous
    intruders, Aethon excavators, things that came
    down here and did not leave. He can animate them
    mid-fight as distractions.

    The bodies manifest as slow-moving obstacles
    rather than active combatants — they intercept
    movement, create chokepoints, and absorb hits
    intended for The Sexton. Destroying them before
    he animates them permanently removes them from
    the encounter. A player who enters aggressively
    and prioritizes the bodies will fight a
    progressively simpler Phase 1. A player who
    focuses only on The Sexton will find themselves
    navigating an increasingly crowded arena.

    The Sexton himself in Phase 1 is methodical.
    He swings the pick in wide arcs with significant
    end-lag. The damage is enormous but the windows
    are generous. The bodies are the difficulty,
    not his moveset.

  PHASE 2 — The Weight of It
    Triggered when his health drops to roughly 40%.
    The Sexton stops, turns to the section of wall
    he was originally embedded in, and tears himself
    free entirely. Phase 1 obscured how large he
    actually is — the embedded section constituted
    roughly a third of his body mass. Phase 2 reveals
    the full figure: significantly taller, the pick
    now two-handed by necessity, his movement faster
    and less predictable.

    Remaining bodies from Phase 1 animate simultaneously
    at the Phase 2 trigger regardless of player progress
    in clearing them. A player who cleared the arena
    in Phase 1 faces only The Sexton. A player who
    ignored them faces The Sexton and a full arena.

    Phase 2 moveset includes a ground slam that sends
    a shockwave through the floor, an overhead strike
    that embeds the pick and briefly immobilizes him
    (punish window), and a charge that crosses the
    arena in two steps. The sanity drain in this room
    accelerates during Phase 2.

  DROPS
    Sexton's Brand — a key item that unlocks the
    deeper cave biomes. Without it, certain passages
    are sealed by mechanisms that use Aethon lock
    technology. Item description reads: "not a key.
    keys open locks. this opens something else."

    Excavation Map — reveals the Aether Structure
    location. Item description reads: "the coordinates
    are annotated in a hand that does not match any
    other writing in the dig site records."

  NOTES FOR DESIGN
    The body-clearing mechanic is the fight's central
    decision. Players must be aware of it by the end
    of Phase 1 without it being explained to them.
    Arena layout should make the bodies visually
    prominent and The Sexton's animation of them
    clearly telegraphed.

    The Phase 2 reveal must be impactful. The wall
    section he tears free from should leave a visible
    void — players should be able to see afterward
    exactly how much of him was hidden.

== AETHER BOSS — VELITH, THE CHAINED MERIDIAN ==

  LORE
    Velith was not placed at the Aether threshold to
    keep players out. It was placed there to keep
    something in.

    Aethon's dimensional research eventually produced
    an entity they could not classify — something that
    emerged from the space between their constructed
    dimensions, vast and incomprehensible and initially
    dormant. They did not destroy it. They bound it,
    using the Aether as a containment space, and chained
    it to the threshold with anchors they believed
    permanent.

    The chains held. Velith has been at the threshold
    for the full span of Aethon's collapse and the
    current civilization's rise. It is in agony. It has
    been in agony for longer than the player's civilization
    has existed. It cannot distinguish between the
    people who chained it and the people who are now
    standing in front of it. It attacks because it
    is suffering and the players are present.

    It is not malevolent. It is in pain and it cannot
    stop.

    Observatory notes reference "the meridian entity"
    in three entries, each more alarmed than the last,
    before the topic disappears from the records entirely.
    Players who connect the Observatory's meridian
    references to Velith's fight are seeing what Aethon
    saw and lost.

  LOCATION
    A massive drifting platform at the upper boundary
    of the Aether — the highest reachable point in the
    dimension. The platform is wide enough that the
    edges are not immediately visible. Four anchor
    pillars stand at cardinal points, each with a
    chain running from it into the air above, where
    Velith is suspended.

  PHASE 1 — Chained
    Velith cannot reach the platform while chained.
    It attacks with the chains themselves — swinging
    lengths of ethereal chain that can cross the
    entire arena, dragging sections of platform
    upward, or whipping the ground in sweeping arcs.
    The chains glow at the point of stress before
    each attack, giving players a directional tell.

    The pillars are destructible. Destroying a pillar
    severs the corresponding chain and permanently
    removes that attack from Velith's moveset. It also
    enrages Velith — its speed increases with each
    severed chain, and the remaining chains hit harder.

    Players choose how many pillars to destroy and
    when. Destroying all four before the health
    threshold triggers Phase 2 immediately but with
    full enrage stacked. Destroying none means
    surviving a longer Phase 1 with the full chain
    moveset but facing a slower Phase 2. Most players
    will find a middle approach — two or three pillars
    destroyed — produces the most manageable overall
    fight.

    The Wyvern Wing glider is essential for avoiding
    certain chain attacks. Players who reach Velith
    without one will find specific attacks nearly
    impossible to dodge on foot.

  PHASE 2 — Unchained
    Triggered when health drops to 40% or all pillars
    are destroyed, whichever comes first. Velith breaks
    free — the remaining chains snap, the remaining
    pillars shatter, and Velith descends to the platform.

    Its scale is disorienting. It fills the upper half
    of the visual space. It moves by repositioning above
    the platform and striking downward — players are
    always fighting something above them, never at
    eye level.

    The platform begins fragmenting. Large sections
    break off and drift, creating gaps. Players without
    the glider are in serious danger. The fight becomes
    a movement challenge as much as a combat challenge —
    maintaining a platform to stand on while dealing
    damage and avoiding strikes from above.

    Sanity drains throughout Phase 2 at an accelerated
    rate. Looking directly at Velith contributes to
    the drain — the visual is designed to be difficult
    to process without triggering a stress response.

  DROPS
    Aether Core — required to craft the three gate
    weapons. Item description reads: "it was keeping
    something contained. it is unclear whether that
    function has ceased or merely changed."

  NOTES FOR DESIGN
    The pillar destruction choice is the fight's
    identity. Difficulty is player-determined, not
    fixed. Speedrunners will destroy all four immediately.
    Careful players will destroy none. The optimal
    line is somewhere between and players will debate
    it.

    Velith should not make sounds associated with
    aggression. Its audio design should communicate
    pain — low sustained tones, harmonic distortion,
    nothing that reads as a roar or a battle cry.

== FINAL SENTINEL — THE USHER ==

  LORE
    The Usher has no origin because it predates origin.
    It is the threshold itself given a shape sufficient
    to be interacted with. It does not guard the passage
    between the Aether and the Final Dimension out of
    assignment or loyalty — it simply occupies that
    position because it has always occupied that position,
    in the same way that a door occupies a doorframe.

    It has no face. It has no consistent shape. Its
    form shifts between observations — players who look
    away and look back will find it slightly different
    each time. Not dramatically. Just enough.

    Aethon's final dimensional records contain a single
    reference to an entity at the threshold described
    as "the administrative presence." The phrasing is
    clinical and clearly written by someone who was
    deeply unsettled and chose bureaucratic language
    as a coping mechanism.

  LOCATION
    The threshold between the Aether and the Final
    Dimension — a space that is neither. The arena
    has no floor in any conventional sense, just a
    surface that holds weight without explanation.
    The architecture around it is half-Aether, half
    something else, as if two places were pressed
    together imperfectly.

  MECHANICS
    The Usher is immune to all damage except that
    dealt by the three gate weapons: the Skyblade,
    the Starcaller Bow, and the Voidweave Staff.
    No chip damage. No totem effects. No magic not
    channeled through the Voidweave Staff.

    In a server group this forces coordination across
    archetypes — at least three players need gate
    weapons. Solo players must craft all three and
    weapon-swap mid-fight, managing stamina and
    positioning across completely different combat
    styles simultaneously.

    The Usher's additional mechanic: it mirrors the
    dominant damage type it has been hit with and
    develops a temporary resistance to it. A player
    who commits to the Skyblade for too long will
    find it shrugging off melee. Forcing a weapon
    swap breaks the resistance. In a group, uncoordinated
    players who all use the same weapon simultaneously
    will trigger the resistance faster.

  PHASE 2
    Triggered at 50% health. The Usher begins copying
    player behavior. If the player has been dodge-heavy,
    it will dodge. If the player has been parrying,
    it will attempt to parry. It reads movement patterns
    specifically and adapts to the individual player,
    not to a fixed Phase 2 script.

    In a group, it copies the most frequent behavior
    across all players simultaneously, creating a
    chaotic mirror of the group's collective habits.

    Looking at The Usher during Phase 2 deals passive
    sanity damage. Not from a visible effect — just
    from looking at it directly for more than a few
    consecutive seconds. The visual is designed to
    produce a cognitive discomfort that the mechanic
    then formalizes.

  DROPS
    Void Shard — activates the Final Dimension structure.
    Item description reads: "the passage is open. it
    was always open. the usher was not preventing entry.
    it was preventing something else from leaving."

== FINAL BOSS — THE WOUND ==

  LORE
    The Wound has no name it gave itself. That is what
    Aethon's last coherent researcher called it in the
    final Observatory log entry before the writing
    degrades into repetition of the word "underneath"
    for eleven lines.

    The Wound is the world's immune system given singular
    form. It did not exist before Aethon's civilization
    crossed a critical threshold of environmental damage.
    It coalesced from the corruption itself — not summoned,
    not created, not born. Simply necessary. When the
    low-level response — the undead, the headcrawlers,
    the sanity drain — proved insufficient, the world
    produced something sufficient.

    It is not intelligent. It is purposeful. The distinction
    matters. It does not hate humanity. It does not want
    anything. It processes the presence of humanity above
    a certain threshold as damage and responds accordingly.
    Below that threshold, humanity is not worth responding
    to. The game's ending is humanity negotiating itself
    below the threshold permanently, at significant cost.

    Everything players have encountered was downstream of
    The Wound. Every corrupted mob, every sanity event,
    every hostile manifestation in every dimension —
    all of it was its peripheral immune response. The
    Wound itself has been passive until now because the
    peripheral response was sufficient. It is engaging
    directly because players, by reaching the Final
    Dimension, have demonstrated that the peripheral
    response has failed.

    It has done this before. Aethon was not the first
    civilization to cross the threshold. The vault in
    the caves — the pre-Aethon architecture, the
    untranslatable script — is evidence of a civilization
    that preceded Aethon by an unknown span. The Wound
    consumed them too. It kept records. Players who
    find the right notes in the right order will realize
    that the Observatory equipment is still running
    because The Wound has been maintaining it.

  LOCATION
    The ruins of Aethon's capital city, now fully inside
    the Final Dimension. The architecture is recognizable
    as human — streets, buildings, civic structures —
    but warped. Grown over. Being slowly digested by
    something that is treating the stonework as foreign
    material to be broken down and reabsorbed.

    Players can read what this city was while fighting
    for their lives in its remains. Readable fragments
    of Aethon text are embedded in the arena walls —
    partial sentences, broken signage, inscriptions
    on half-dissolved civic monuments. None of them
    finish. The city's story is as incomplete here
    as it is everywhere else. The Wound did not
    preserve it. It simply hasn't finished with it yet.

  PHASE 1 — RECOGNITION
    The Wound does not immediately engage. For the
    first thirty seconds it circles the arena at a
    distance, its form indistinct at range — players
    cannot clearly identify what they are looking at.
    Tendrils of corruption probe the ground around
    the player during this period. They deal real
    damage if stood on. Standing still is not an
    option.

    The phase is not a grace period. It is teaching
    the player that this fight will not allow passive
    behavior.

    When The Wound engages, it fights with constructs —
    Aethon architecture weaponized and animated.
    Pillars hurled, bridges used as rams, civic
    structures collapsed onto the player's position.
    The Wound itself does not attack directly in
    Phase 1. It uses the city as ammunition. The
    distinction is intentional: it is not fighting
    the player yet. It is using available resources
    to remove an irritant.

    Phantom notes appear briefly on the arena walls
    during lulls — fragments of Aethon's final days,
    rendered in a flickering visual style that makes
    them readable only if players are not moving.
    They are purely atmospheric. Players who stop
    to read them during subsequent runs will piece
    together the full Aethon timeline. Players who
    never stop will never see them. This is correct.

    Sanity drains slowly throughout Phase 1.

  PHASE 2 — REVULSION
    Triggered at 65% health. The constructs collapse
    simultaneously. The Wound sheds the Aethon
    architecture entirely.

    What is underneath is biological, massive, and
    wrong in ways that resist description. The design
    intent is visual discomfort through incorrectness
    rather than overt grotesquerie — limbs that bend
    in directions that are almost correct, geometry
    that the eye processes as slightly off without
    being able to identify why, movement that suggests
    weight without following the physical rules weight
    implies.

    Sanity drains significantly faster in Phase 2.
    This is not a punishment mechanic. It is a lore
    statement. The human perceptual system was not
    designed to process what The Wound actually is.
    Players with high sanity reserves from Cleric
    or Apothecary builds will notice the drain less.
    Players at low sanity entering Phase 2 will
    trigger Corruption Events during the fight —
    phantom enemies spawning mid-boss encounter is
    not designed but is an emergent consequence of
    poor sanity management.

    Phantom versions of earlier bosses manifest
    periodically during Phase 2 — Aldric, The Sexton,
    Velith. Not as full encounters. They appear for
    ten to fifteen seconds, attack, and dissolve.
    They are things The Wound consumed. The implication —
    that it has catalogued everything it has ever
    processed and can reproduce any of it — should
    land without being stated. The fight with Aldric
    is now recontextualized. Players who connected
    with his tragedy will feel it differently here.

    The Wound's own attacks in Phase 2 are direct —
    biological strikes, sweeping limb attacks, ground
    impacts that send corruption shockwaves across
    the arena. The moveset is large but telegraphed.
    The difficulty is not the attacks individually.
    It is managing sanity, managing phantom spawns,
    managing the scale of the arena, and managing
    the psychological weight of what the fight is
    telling the player about everything that came before.

  PHASE 3 — ACCEPTANCE
    Triggered at 30% health. The arena goes quiet.
    The Wound contracts — not visually retreating,
    but condensing, as if gathering itself. The result
    is near-human in scale. Hunched. Still.

    Then it walks toward the player. Steadily. Without
    telegraphed attacks, without spectacle, without
    sound. It simply advances.

    Every hit it takes closes over. Wounds open and
    seal in seconds. Conventional damage produces
    no visible effect on its health. Players who do
    not understand the mechanic will spend this phase
    in escalating panic. Players who read the Observatory
    notes will remember the reference to a "resonant
    counter-frequency" in Aethon's failed attempts to
    halt the corruption and will understand what the
    Aetheric Core in their inventory is for.

    The Aetheric Core must be activated in proximity
    to The Wound during Phase 3. This is never stated
    anywhere in the game. It is the inference players
    are guided toward by the accumulated lore. Players
    who did not engage with the lore will discover it
    through desperation, community knowledge, or the
    simple fact that nothing else is working.

    Activating the Core triggers the ending sequence.

  THE ENDING
    The Wound does not die. It recedes. The animation
    is slow and the audio drops almost entirely —
    not silence, just the absence of the frequencies
    that were present throughout the fight.

    The Aether collapses. Any player currently in
    the Aether dimension is returned to the overworld
    by force. The dimensional structures cease
    functioning. The sky changes. Where the Aether
    used to glow faintly above the cloud layer —
    visible throughout the entire game as a background
    detail — there is now a permanent absence. Not
    darkness, not cloud cover. Just a scar where
    something used to be. It is visible from anywhere
    in the world on a clear day and it does not heal.

    The corruption stops spreading. The existing scars
    remain. The dead farmland stays dead. The logged
    vale does not regrow. The open pit does not close.
    The server win condition triggers and logs as a
    global event. That is the full extent of the
    world's formal acknowledgment.

    Nobody says anything to the Crow. No NPC speaks
    to what happened. No other player is required to
    respond. The world simply continues, indifferent
    to the weight of what was just done in it.

    Over the hours and in-game days that follow,
    natural crows begin gathering at the Core
    placement site. They arrive in small numbers
    at first, then more. They stay. They do not
    behave unusually. They simply remain, in growing
    numbers, at the site of the activation. Players
    who return days later will find them still there.
    No note explains it. No item description
    references it. It just happens.

    The final readable item found at the activation
    site is authored by no identifiable source, in
    no writing system that appears elsewhere in the
    game, rendered in the player's language without
    explanation:

    "the readings have stabilized. the anomaly has
    accepted containment. we are logging this as
    a success."

    The Wound kept records. It always watched. It
    considered this outcome a success too. What that
    implies about the next cycle is left unwritten.
    The Crow keeps playing. The world is still here.
    It just no longer needs them.

  NOTES FOR DESIGN
    Phase 3's silence is the fight's most important
    moment. The contrast with Phase 2's scale must
    be total. No music. Reduced ambient sound. The
    Wound walking toward the player in near-silence
    while they scramble to understand what to do
    is the culmination of everything the game has
    been building.

    The Aetheric Core activation should not be
    obvious. The UI should not prompt it. Players
    should arrive at it themselves.

    The phantom boss appearances in Phase 2 must
    use the actual boss movesets — scaled down,
    shortened duration, but mechanically accurate.

    No voiceover, no closing narration, no text
    explanation of what the flat sanity meter means.
    It goes still. The game continues. Players

  - What the Merchant caravan survivor's final note says
  - What is at the bottom of the Flooded Mine
  - Whether the Ancient Vault's pre-Aethon artifact has
    additional lore implications
